    <p><strong class="heading">Environmental sustainability</strong> is a key component in grappling with the issue of climate change.
      It's a globally recognized issue, but one that can be overlooked in our daily lives.

    <h3 class="heading"> STATISTICS</h3>
    <p> Responsible consumption and production is just one of seventeen of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.
      The following statistics are from the official website: </p>
    <!--listed statistics and links important resources-->
    <blockquote cite="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/">
      <ul>
        <li>Each year, an estimated one third of all food produced – equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes worth around $1 trillion – ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices.
        </li>
        <li>If people worldwide switched to energy efficient light bulbs the world would save US$120 billion annually.</li>
        <li>Should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>According to statistics and descriptions provided by the <cite>United States Environmental Protection Agency</cite> the global emmisions by economic sectors are as follows:</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>Electricity and Heat Production (i.e. the burning of coal, natural gas, and oil for electricity and heat)</li>
      <li>Industry (i.e. emissions from chemical, metallurgical, and minenral transformation processes)</li>
      <li>Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (o.e. cultivation of crops and livestock, as well as deforestation)</li>
      <li>Transportation (i.e. fossil fuels burned in road, rail, air, and marine transportation)</li>

  <!-- an example of sustainable habits being implemented... at Bishop's! -->

    <h3 class="heading"> HOW BISHOP'S IS HANDLING SUSTAINABILITY</h3>
    <br />
    <h5> What's an example of sustainable habits being implemented in an organization? </h5>
    <p> At <a class="heading" href="https://www.bishops.com" target="_blank">The Bishop's School</a>,
      sustainability has played a quiet, but important role. There are solar panels lined on the rooftops of various buildings (like the gym),
      and an ongoing composting initiative. </p>
    <p> The composting initative began in the fall of the 2018-2019 school year, where volunteers in the Sustainability Club would transport food scraps to the compost bins behind the Science Center.
      At first, these scraps came straight from the kitchen preparation, being leftovers of fruits and vegetables not used in the student lunches (i.e. cabbage heads and carrot skins).
      Slowly, it progressed into something larger, where post-consumer food was also composted (i.e. banana peels, apple cores, orange skins). This takes form in the green bins that
      were placed around the cafeteria dining area. The fresh fruits and vegetables later become home to our tiny worm farm, where it was transformed into nice soil for the small garden near the field. </p>
    <img id="gif" src="positiveearth.gif" alt="Sustainability" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
    <p> With a virtual learning environment this year, we are focusing more on raising awareness and building <strong>sustainable</strong> habits from home through newsletters, videos, and guest speakers.
      However, the composting initiative will be restarting! Obviously, there are still safety concerns with handling post-consumer food, so the compost materials will be coming straight from the kitchen.
      Aside from this, something in the works is the idea of Meatless Mondays. To be approved, this requires the agreement of the majority of the student body. </p>
